Cat and huamn:
Alignment scores = 3717.0
Identical percentage = 0.8521739130434782

Cat and mouse
Alignment scores = 3592.0
Identical percentage = 0.8173913043478261

Mouse and human
Alignment scores = 3579.0
Identical percentage = 0.8211180124223603

Interpretation:
The alignment score and identical percentage of human and cat are both the biggest. 
So cat and human are most closely related. 
Based on the results, cat and human are more likely to have the same ancestor than human and mouse, mouse and cat.
Cats and humans are more closely related and have similar evolutionary paths.

More detailedly, the provided sequences represent the ACE2 protein in humans, cats, and mice. ACE2, also known as angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, is a crucial protein involved in the regulation of blood pressure and fluid balance in the body through the renin-angiotensin system. Analyzing these sequences allows us to assess the similarities and differences among the ACE2 proteins across these species.
The comparison results reveal that the ACE2 protein sequences in humans and cats exhibit the highest level of similarity, as indicated by a score of 3717 and an identical amino acid percentage of 85.22%. On the other hand, the comparisons between human and mouse, as well as between mouse and cat, show slightly lower scores and percentages of identical amino acids. Specifically, the human-mouse comparison yielded a score of 3592 and a 81.74% identity, while the mouse-cat comparison resulted in a score of 3579 with an 82.11% identity. These values suggest a lesser degree of similarity between these pairs of sequences compared to the human-cat pair.
It is worth noting that ACE2 is a conserved protein, implying a high degree of similarity across all three sequences.
